# Particle_Simulation

## Particle Simulation (Gravity and Bouncing Ball)
This project simulates the motion of a ball under the influence of gravity in a 2D plane. The ball will bounce off the ground with energy loss (damping) after each collision. The simulation runs for a fixed number of time steps, and the ball's position and velocity are updated in each step. The ball eventually loses enough energy to stop bouncing.

## Features:
- Ball affected by gravity (9.8 m/s²)
- Bouncing with damping (energy loss)
- Simulation stops once the ball’s movement slows down significantly

## Setup:
1. Clone the repository
2. Compile the C code with a C compiler (e.g., `clang`)
3. Run the simulation

## Goals:
This project serves as a basic introduction to particle physics simulations and C programming concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, and structs.
